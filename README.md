## IT Essentials

During my experience with IT essentials I learned a couple of profitable skills while learning from the course. One of them was learning about the specific parts of a laptop, desktop, and a printer. I also aquired the skill of how to reformate a desktop since I had worked on a lab that had me take apart a desktop computer and put it back together with some extra hard drives and to also reformate the device over a few weeks. A skill that I aquired that will help is the ability to respond and handle talking to customers and other people since the course gave advice on how to handle specific types of customers.
