## IT Essentials

During my experience with IT essentials I learned a couple of profitable skills while learning from the course. One of them was learning about the specific parts of a laptop, desktop, and a printer. I also aquired the skill of how to reformate a desktop since I had worked on a lab that had me take apart a desktop computer and put it back together with some extra hard drives and to also reformate the device over a few weeks. A skill that I aquired that will help is the ability to respond and handle talking to customers and other people since the course gave advice on how to handle specific types of customers.

**Heres my IT Essentials Certification for the course.**

## Alberta Computers for Schools

Alberta Computers for Schools and no profit organization that takes in students over a five or four month period and gives real life work on refurbrishing device that have been donated to them and then give them away to organizations or schools that need request them. I was there for four days to get some experience in how to refurbrish a desktop and other devices such as a laptops. The experience their helped me get a feel for what it is like to work as a IT technician and also how to hand in an order and pack it up properly but also got some experience with doing some inventory work as well.
