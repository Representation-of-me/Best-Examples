## IT Essentials

During my experience with IT essentials I learned a couple of profitable skills while learning from the course. One of them was learning about the specific parts of a laptop, desktop, and a printer. I also aquired the skill of how to reformate a desktop since I had worked on a lab that had me take apart a desktop computer and put it back together with some extra hard drives and to also reformate the device over a few weeks. A skill that I aquired that will help is the ability to respond and handle talking to customers and other people since the course gave advice on how to handle specific types of customers.

**Heres my IT Essentials Certification for the course.**

## ITN

Introductory To Networking has given help with an understanding with how to read and make a network and how it works as well. I learned how to read and understand how to submask an networks IP address and learned how to make and decipher both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Learning also how to plan out and secure a network when making one helps in making a network secure, flexible to change, and stable in traffic flow as well.
I am curretnly making a physical network to apply my knowledge and is still in the making.

My certification for the course is still not aquired yet.


## Alberta Computers for Schools

Alberta Computers for Schools and no profit organization that takes in students over a five or four month period and gives real life work on refurbrishing device that have been donated to them and then give them away to organizations or schools that need request them. I was there for four days to get some experience in how to refurbrish a desktop and other devices such as a laptops. The experience their helped me get a feel for what it is like to work as a IT technician and also how to hand in an order and pack it up properly but also got some experience with doing some inventory work as well.

## Working for FTA Enterprises

FTA Enterprises is a company that works on repairing and maintaining heavy equipement and machinery but also has given it service in jobs that require the use of operating heavy machinery as well. 

I worked there for over two summers 8 hours a day and was mostly the extra pair of hands around the shops with cleaning and maintaining the areas to help keep things flowing since the company was getting lots of work orders and didn't have any time to be able to clean up much, I did help out with other tasks as well since working on machinery often needed more then one person to help observe and navigate parts into place and such. The skills that I developed and learned there help out alot though with it helped me develope a good work ethic and develope other helpful skills like how to work some heavy equipment and also learned how the do some land work as well.
